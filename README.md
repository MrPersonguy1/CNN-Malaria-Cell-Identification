🦠 CNN Malaria Cell Identification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify whether a cell image is infected with malaria or not infected. It’s a type of image classification project using deep learning and computer vision.

📚 What You’ll Learn
How to load and preprocess image data

How CNNs work for image recognition

How to build and train a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras

How to evaluate a model’s accuracy and performance

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras (for building the CNN)

OpenCV (for loading and resizing images)

NumPy (for handling data)

Matplotlib (for plotting accuracy and loss)

🧠 How It Works
Images are loaded from two folders: one for infected cells and one for uninfected cells.

All images are resized to the same shape and converted into arrays.

The image data is split into training and testing sets.

A CNN model is built with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.

The model is trained on the data to learn the difference between infected and uninfected cells.

Finally, the model’s performance is tested and visualized.

🚀 How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.

Install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib tensorflow
Download the malaria dataset (with Parasitized and Uninfected folders).

Put the dataset in the correct path or update the file paths in the script.

Open the .py file or use a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to run it step-by-step.
